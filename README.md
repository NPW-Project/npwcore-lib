Npwcore Library
=======

A pure and powerful JavaScript NPW library.

## Principles

NewPowerCoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the NPW network allows for highly resilient npw infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement npw apps and services.

## Get Started

```
npm install npwcore-lib
```

```
bower install npwcore-lib
```
